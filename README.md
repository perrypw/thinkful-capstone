This is the repository for my capstone for the Thinkful Data Science bootcamp, which relates to predictive modeling for TV show cancellation. The notebooks are in linear order and include:

1. Introduction
2-3. Data Acquisition and Cleaning
4-5. Data Exploration and Clustering
6. Supervised modeling
7. word2vec applications
8. keras + word2vec
9. Further model evaluation, experimentation, and concluding thoughts

Enjoy!
